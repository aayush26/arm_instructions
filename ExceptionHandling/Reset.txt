//When reset input is asserted on the processor, the ARM processor immediately stops execution of 
the current instruction. When reset is de-asserted, the following actions are performed:

R14_svc = UNPREDICTABLE value
SPSR_svc = UNPREDICTABLE value
CPSR[4:0] = 0b10011				//Enter supervisor mode
CPSR[5] = 0					//Execute in ARM state
CPSR[6] = 1					//Disable fast interrupts
CPSR[7] = 1					//disable normal interrupts
CPSR[8] = 1					//disable imprecise aborts (v6 only)
CPSR[9] = CP15_reg1_EEbit			//Endianness on exception entry
if high vectors configures then
	PC = 0xFFFF0000
else 
	PC = 0x00000000


//After reset, the ARM proseccor begins execution at address 0x00000000 or 0xFFFF0000 in Supervisor mode 
//with interrupts disabled.
